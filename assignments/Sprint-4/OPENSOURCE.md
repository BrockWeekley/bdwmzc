### - Why Contribute to Open Source Software:
        This article finds discusses the findings of a study which found the motivators for open source developers to include three major
    categories: extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation, and internalized extrinsic motivation.
        
        This is a fascinating way to categorize open source developers as essentially all motivations can be categorized into these three
    areas. Money as an extrinsic motivator, pride and fun as an intrinsic motivator, and peer perception as an internalized extrinsic
    motivator.
    
        I believe that extrinsic motivators are the least powerful, but most prevelent motivator in open source development right now.
    A person that believes in a project, enjoys working on it, and finds pride in their work is going to be much more productive than
    an individual who is simply paid to do their job and doesn't enjoy the open source project. It could be possible that we are 
    missing out on a much larger boost to open source productivity if we could highlight intrinsic motivators in the field as highly
    as we do extrinsic ones.
    
### - A Guid to Contributing to Open Source Software:

        This was less of an article and more of an introduction into the world of open source development. However, it is very efficient
    in listing the reasons that open source is effective as well as describing how to build an open source project ourselves.
    
        Some of the big highlights of the introduction was that open source attracts talent, lowers maintenance costs, and influences
    direction. I agree that open source does all of these things and is very beneficial in this way. By providing code, users become
    familiar and accustomed to working with it, which means you could potentially have thousands of expert developers ready to fix
    problems and lead the project in the right way. This is an incredibly powerful tool and laying it out this way makes it seem like
    a no-brainer that more companies should be participating in.
