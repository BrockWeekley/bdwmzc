# Reflection

### For this sprint, I found three open source SSO projects that I was interested in:

- Keycloak SSO
    - Keycloak offers many services out of box for secure authentication for Red Hat SSOand is a very highly used service
    - Keycloak is available on OpenJDK, Docker, Openshift, Podman, and Kubernetes
    
- Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
    - SAML is an open standard for authentication, a set of message bindings, a set of XML protocols, and a set of profiles.
    - SAML allows for single sign on (SSO) across domains. 
    - It has been accepted as a standard by many organizations.
    
- Google's Firebase Authentication
    - Google built SDK and ready-made UI library for authentication and identification
    - Allows for anonymous login as well as integration with every popular authenticator so users can use their own logins from other apps.
    - Built for modern web apps
    
### I ended up choosing Google's Firebase Authentication as it seemed the easiest to get started with and the most simple/best documented.

### I was able to get a working version up for my personal website at: https://www.bdwmzc.com

### I did not encounter any issues, as the setup was easy and well documented.
