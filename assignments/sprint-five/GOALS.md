# Goals

The purpose of my application is to provide a hub to organize my resume, github, and completed projects in one place.

The audience of my application will mainly be employers, as well as possibly developers looking for web development help in the future.

I will also be gathering data on the users that log in to my application, which will eventually allow them access to my hosted apps, so that I can see what kind of people are interested in my work and how they plan to use it.
