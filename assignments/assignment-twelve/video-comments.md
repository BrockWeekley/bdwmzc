# CHAOSS Evolution Meeting

### I was actually present for this meeting so got to listen in first hand. I thought the process was very informative, looking in on the review process for CHAOSS projects. Seeing the process of the metric review was repetitive, but I could definitely see how this process was useful in finalizing this metric that was submitted.

### I think the metric itself was a great addition to the list of metrics for this working group. I also made my metric for this working group and the one talked about in the video seems to be a good fit. I would like to see this implemented in the future of the CHAOSS project as inactive contributors could be a great indicator for the 'Value' portion of the project.
